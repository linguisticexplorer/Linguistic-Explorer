      <p>TerraLing is a collection of searchable linguistic databases that allows users to discover which properties (morphological, syntactic, and semantic)
        characterize a language, as well as how these properties relate across languages. This system is designed to be free to the public and open-ended.
        Anyone can use the database to perform queries. Linguistic researchers can put up their own data using the open-ended framework we provide.</p>
      <p>The data of each project is held in a database called a group. Visit the list of <%= link_to "public groups", groups_path %> to begin searching.
        <%= link_to 'Sign up for an account', new_user_registration_path %> to get access more groups and search features.</p>
      <p>To read about updates and post questions, please visit <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sswllinguistics">our Google Group</a>.</p>
      <p>TerraLing is the next generation of the <%= link_to "Linguistic Explorer", "http://linguisticexplorer.org/" %> project. The linguistic leads have
        been Chris Collins, Hilda Koopman and Richard Kayne.
        The principal developers of the original site were Sangeeta Vishwanath, Hiral Rajani, and Jillian
        Kozyra.
        The principal developers of this site have been Ross Kaffenberger, Alex Lobascio (Bosh), and Marco Liberati.
        The system architect is Dennis Shasha.</p>
